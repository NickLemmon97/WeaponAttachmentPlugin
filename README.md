# WeaponAttachmentPlugin
This is an implementation of the WeaponSchematicSystem that I created as part of Black Eye Galaxy developed by 
Pack A Punch.  This is a bare bones implementation with all the game specific code removed.

# How it works
1. Attach the WeaponAttachmentComponent to the weapon or item that you want to add attachments to.  Set the 
Weapon type if needed and set the available attachment locations.
2. Create some C++ or Blueprinted BaseSchematics
3. Make a world schematic so the player can pick it up in the world*
